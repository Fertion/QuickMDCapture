This is an Android app that allows you to quickly create notes in MD format from the notification bar. This allows you to quickly create notes, as the notification panel can be opened quickly without distracting you from another app, such as the e-book you are reading. Originally, the app was created to work with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), but it can also be used with other note-taking apps that support the .md format if needed.

The app creates a persistent notification in the notification panel.

When you tap on it, a dialog box opens for entering your note.

After that, the file is saved in .md format at the path specified in the settings.

**Important: I am not a programmer, and the code was written by neural networks, so I don't fully understand how it works in detail. Therefore, while Iâ€™ve tested the app to the best of my ability, use it at your own risk. I would also greatly appreciate any feedback and advice.**
